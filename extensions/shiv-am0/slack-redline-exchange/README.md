# Slack Redline Exchange

Cross-company contract negotiation inside a shared Slack Connect channel, built on the
SuperDocs API. A vendor and a customer drop a contract into a shared channel; each side
proposes edits, both sides approve their own side of the negotiation, and the app keeps
one authoritative current version with a full audit trail. Internal-only commentary
never crosses into the shared channel. The final export carries the whole negotiation
as OOXML track changes for the lawyers.

Built for the SuperDocs engineering task, assigned card: *Slack Connect cross-company
redline exchange*.

## What SuperDocs does here

This app is a broker, not a second AI. Every edit is drafted by SuperDocs; this codebase
decides who may ask for one, who must agree before it lands, and what may never be said
in front of the other company.

| SuperDocs surface | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/documents/upload-base64` | Opening a session when a contract is dropped in the channel; supporting documents are added with `open_mode: background` so they never steal focus |
| `POST /v1/chat/async` | Handing a plain-English instruction to the drafting AI, targeted at one document in a multi-document session |
| `GET /v1/jobs/{job_id}` | Polling to a turnpoint, with progress posted into the Slack thread on slow jobs |
| `POST /v1/chat/{session}/approve` | Submitting the whole batch of per-change decisions once both sides have voted |
| `POST /v1/chat/{session}/continue` | Answering SuperDocs when it pauses mid-run |
| `POST /v1/documents/export` | The clean export — the negotiated document as it now stands |

Review mode (`approval_mode: ask_every_time`) is what makes dual consent possible at all:
changes are held as proposals until a human decides, and this app simply requires *two*
humans from different companies instead of one.

The redline export is deliberately **not** a SuperDocs call. It is rebuilt locally from
the original bytes plus the recorded decisions, so the negotiation trail survives even
if the API is unreachable.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run python demo/run_demo.py   # full negotiation, keyless, against the built-in fake
uv run pytest                    # 104 tests, all offline, no live key required
```

That is the one documented command a stranger needs: `uv run python demo/run_demo.py`
prints a complete negotiation — proposal cards, dual approval, a blocked leak attempt,
multi-document attachment, boundary-aware search, exports, audit trail, and a
kill/resume — and writes `.docx` exports to `demo/output/`.

Other entrypoints:

```bash
uv run uvicorn redline.main:app --reload        # machine-drivable REST surface + /docs
uv run python -m redline.slack.run_slack        # the real Slack app (needs .env, see below)
uv run python scripts/make_demo_docs.py         # regenerate the synthetic demo contracts
uv run ruff check src tests --fix
```

### Configuration

`.env.example` is a **template and is never read by the app**. Settings resolve in this
order: real environment variables → `.env` → the defaults in [config.py](src/redline/config.py).
With no `.env` present, the defaults apply — including `FAKE_MODE=true`, which is why the
entire test suite and demo run with no key and no network. To go live:

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # then fill it in; .env is gitignored
```

## Running it live, end to end (real Slack + real SuperDocs)

Everything below is optional — the demo and tests prove the same behavior offline — but
this is how to watch it work for real.

### 1. Get a SuperDocs key

Sign up at [use.superdocs.app](https://use.superdocs.app), then create an API key. Your
agent can also self-enroll via `POST /v1/agents/signup` and check itself with
`GET /v1/agents/whoami` (see [docs.superdocs.app](https://docs.superdocs.app)). Put the
key in `.env` as `SUPERDOCS_API_KEY` and set `FAKE_MODE=false`.

Once live, every deal creates a SuperDocs **session** holding the authoritative document,
so you can open [use.superdocs.app](https://use.superdocs.app) and watch the document,
its version history, and pending review-mode changes update as the negotiation runs. In
`FAKE_MODE=true` nothing leaves your machine and the UI stays empty — that is expected.

### 2. Create the Slack app

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → *From scratch*.
2. **Socket Mode** → toggle **Enable Socket Mode** on. This is why no public URL or
   ngrok tunnel is needed: the app dials out over a WebSocket.
3. **Basic Information → App-Level Tokens** → *Generate Token* with the
   `connections:write` scope → copy the `xapp-…` value into `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`.
4. **OAuth & Permissions → Bot Token Scopes**, add:
   `commands`, `chat:write`, `files:read`, `files:write`, `channels:history`,
   `groups:history`, `channels:read`, `groups:read`.
5. **Slash Commands** → *Create New Command* → `/redline`, any description. (With Socket
   Mode on, the Request URL field is not used.)
6. **Event Subscriptions** → enable → **Subscribe to bot events**: `file_shared`, `message.channels`.
7. **Install to Workspace**, then copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`) into
   `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.

### 3. Create the channels

Create three channels and invite the bot to each (`/invite @your-app`):

| Channel | `.env` variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#deal-acme-globex` | `SHARED_CHANNEL` | both companies; cards and versions land here |
| `#vendor-internal` | `VENDOR_INTERNAL_CHANNEL` | vendor-only commentary |
| `#customer-internal` | `CUSTOMER_INTERNAL_CHANNEL` | customer-only commentary |

Put the **channel IDs**, not names, in `.env` — open a channel, click its name, and copy
the ID from the bottom of the About tab (starts with `C`).

**Two workspaces vs one.** Real Slack Connect means two separate workspaces, one per
company, and the app decides your side from your workspace (`team_id`). If you only have
one workspace, set `VENDOR_TEAM_ID` and `CUSTOMER_TEAM_ID` to that same team ID and use
`SIDE_OVERRIDE_USERS` to pin specific users to each side:

```
SIDE_OVERRIDE_USERS=U01ALICE:vendor,U02BOB:customer
```

This is a testing affordance only; the workspace mapping remains the real mechanism.

### 4. Run it and watch

```bash
uv run python -m redline.slack.run_slack
```

It validates the configuration first and refuses to start with an exact list of what is
missing and where to find it. On start it logs the resolved channels, policy, and
database path, and resumes any job left in flight by a previous run.

Then, in Slack:

1. Drag a `.docx` contract into the shared channel → the bot opens a deal and posts the
   deal ID. (A second file dropped later attaches as a supporting document rather than
   replacing the contract.)
2. `/redline propose <deal_id> Cap liability at $50k in the liability section`
3. Watch the proposal cards appear with per-side Approve/Reject buttons. Slow jobs post
   a "still working" note rather than going silent.
4. Click **Approve (Vendor)** then **Approve (Customer)** → the change commits and the
   version bumps. Under `dual_consent`, one approval alone is not enough.
5. `/redline note <deal_id> our real walkaway is $250k` **from your internal channel** —
   it stays there. Try `/redline propose` from the internal channel and watch it get
   refused.
6. `/redline search <deal_id> liability`, `/redline docs <deal_id>`,
   `/redline history <deal_id>`, `/redline export <deal_id> redline`.

**Monitoring while it runs.** The process logs every command, decision, and error at
INFO. For state, the SQLite database is directly inspectable at any time:

```bash
sqlite3 redline.db "SELECT ts, side, actor, action FROM audit_log ORDER BY seq;"
sqlite3 redline.db "SELECT id, state, vendor_decision, customer_decision FROM proposals;"
sqlite3 redline.db "SELECT job_id, state, instruction FROM jobs;"
```

The REST surface can be run at the same time against the same `DATABASE_PATH` to read
status/history while Slack drives the negotiation.

## What it does

1. **One authoritative document per deal.** A single SuperDocs session backs the whole
   negotiation. Middleware (this app) mediates every read and write; neither side talks
   to SuperDocs directly.
2. **Cards visible to both sides.** Each proposed change becomes a Block Kit card in the
   shared channel with per-side Approve/Reject buttons. Both workspaces see the exact
   same card, the exact same version number, at all times.
3. **Configurable approval policy.** `dual_consent` (default) commits a change only when
   both sides approve it; any rejection is sent to SuperDocs with the rejecting side's
   feedback attached. `proposer_only` commits on the proposing side's approval alone —
   the counterparty's decision is recorded for the audit trail but doesn't gate.
4. **Internal notes stay internal.** `/redline note` (or `add_internal_note`) posts only
   to the author's own internal channel and is stored separately from anything ever sent
   to the shared channel or to SuperDocs.
5. **Runtime boundary enforcement.** Every outbound message to the shared channel is
   checked against every stored internal note before it is sent (`core/boundary.py`).
   Every edit instruction must provably originate from the shared channel; anything from
   an internal channel is refused before it ever reaches SuperDocs, and the refusal is
   reported back to the acting side's own internal channel only.
6. **Survives being killed.** All negotiation state (jobs, proposals, decisions, audit
   log) lives in SQLite. `NegotiationService.recover_pending()` re-drives any job that
   was mid-flight and re-posts only the Slack cards that are missing (`card_ts IS NULL`)
   — nothing is duplicated, nothing already-finished is lost. See
   `tests/test_kill_resume.py`.
7. **Machine-drivable end to end.** The FastAPI surface in `api/routes.py` exposes the
   same four SuperDocs-shaped primitives — start a deal, propose, decide (approve),
   export — plus status/history/notes, so a script can run the whole negotiation with no
   human clicking through Slack. See `tests/test_rest_surface.py`.
8. **Lawyer-facing export.** `export/track_changes.py` builds a docx locally from the
   original source file plus the recorded negotiation trail: committed changes become
   real OOXML `w:ins`/`w:del` runs attributed to "Vendor" or "Customer"; rejected
   proposals go into an honest appendix table with the feedback that killed them;
   anything we can't confidently place gets its own "Unmatched Changes" section instead
   of a guess.
9. **Multi-document deals.** A deal holds one authoritative contract plus any number of
   supporting documents (amendments, SOWs, counterparty markups). Supporting files join
   the same SuperDocs session using `open_mode=background`, so they are editable and
   searchable while the contract stays focused — an untargeted `/redline propose` always
   edits the contract, never whatever was uploaded most recently. Target another document
   explicitly with `--doc <name>`. See `tests/test_multidocument.py`.
10. **Boundary-aware search.** `/redline search <deal_id> <query>` searches document text,
    proposals, and the audit trail. The same boundary rule applies to reads as to writes:
    a search from the shared channel can only ever return shared material, and internal
    notes are reachable only from an internal channel — and then only that side's own
    notes. One side can never search the other's commentary. See `tests/test_search.py`.
11. **Progress reporting on slow jobs.** SuperDocs documents that large documents can take
    thirty seconds to several minutes with no visible progress. Rather than let the
    channel go silent (and look crashed), the app posts a "still working, this is not a
    failure" note. A failed progress ping is recorded in the audit trail and never aborts
    an otherwise healthy job. See `tests/test_progress.py`.

  api/routes.py + main.py: FastAPI wrapping NegotiationService for machine-driven use
  export/track_changes.py: original docx + resolved proposals -> lawyer-facing redline
```

`NegotiationService` is framework-free: it depends only on `Store`, `SuperDocsClient`,
and a `MessengerPort` protocol (`post_message` / `update_message` / `upload_file`).
Three things implement `MessengerPort`: `SlackMessenger` (real Bolt client, thin),
`InMemoryMessenger` (tests, demo, and the REST server), and nothing else — the whole
negotiation state machine, boundary guard, and approval logic is exercised identically
whether it's driven by real Slack, the simulator, or the REST API.

## Locked design decisions (and the reasoning)

These were fixed before implementation and are echoed here so the reasoning survives
in one place, not just in commit history.

- **One SuperDocs session per deal, one middleware.** Neither side ever calls SuperDocs
  directly; this app is the only client of the SuperDocs session for a given deal, which
  is what makes "both sides always see the same version" a property of the architecture
  rather than something we have to reconcile after the fact.
- **`dual_consent` reading of "each side approves its own positions."** The brief says
  "each side's proposed changes appear as cards visible to both, each side approves its
  own positions." We read this as: by default, a change only takes effect once *both*
  sides have signed off on it (`dual_consent`); `proposer_only` is offered as the more
  literal reading (a side only ever needs to approve what it itself proposed) for
  negotiations where the parties want unilateral commit rights. This is a
  policy field on the deal, not a hardcoded assumption — configurable per-deal.
- **REST only, MCP deliberately skipped.** The assigned card names both REST and MCP as
  acceptable surfaces ("anything specified against the REST API may be built on MCP, and
  the other way around"). We built the SuperDocs-facing client (`superdocs/client.py`)
  once, against the documented REST endpoints, and exposed our *own* machine interface
  as REST (`api/routes.py`) rather than as an MCP server, because the task's minimum
  contract is four calls (upload, chat, approve, export) and REST gets us there with far
  less scaffolding than standing up an MCP server for a single-deal negotiation flow.
  Given the time budget, we judged the boundary/approval/resume correctness work more
  valuable than a second protocol adapter around the same four calls.
- **Simulator-first.** All business logic in `core/negotiation.py` is plumbing-free: it
  never imports `slack_bolt`. `slack/simulator.py` drives the exact same
  `slack/handlers.py` functions the real Bolt adapter uses, through an in-memory
  two-workspace fake Slack. Every test in this repo — including the ones that exercise
  Slack Connect's two-sided visibility — runs with `FAKE_MODE=true` and no real Slack
  connection, which is also what makes the whole suite keyless.
- **Boundary guard is runtime enforcement, not a lint pass.** `core/boundary.py` is
  called on the hot path of every outbound shared-channel message and every incoming
  edit instruction. It is not a code-review checklist; a violation raises, is logged to
  the audit trail as `boundary_violation_blocked` / `propose_refused`, and is reported
  to the acting side's own internal channel — never to the shared channel, and never
  silently swallowed.
- **Track-changes export is generated locally.** SuperDocs's own `/documents/export`
  gives us the current clean version. The lawyer-facing redline is built by this app,
  locally, from the original uploaded bytes plus the locally-recorded proposal/decision
  trail — nothing about the redline export depends on a SuperDocs feature that doesn't
  exist yet.

## Approval policy, precisely

For a single proposal:

- `dual_consent`: the proposal is "ready" once *both* `vendor_decision` and
  `customer_decision` are recorded. It commits only if both are `approved`. If either
  side rejects, the rejecting side's feedback (if any) is sent to SuperDocs alongside the
  decision. If every proposal in that job's batch is rejected and at least one carries
  feedback, SuperDocs runs its own revision round and we re-post new cards for the
  revised proposals; if at least one proposal in the batch was approved, the rejected
  ones are simply discarded and marked `rejected` (no revision).
- `proposer_only`: the proposal is "ready" once the *proposing* side has decided.
  Only that side's decision determines commit/reject. The counterparty may still click
  Approve/Reject — it's recorded in the audit trail and shown on the card — but it does
  not gate.

## What formats and domains this accepts

Source documents: `.docx`, `.md`, `.txt`, `.html`/`.htm` (via `FakeSuperDocs`'s parser in
tests/demo; the real SuperDocs API's own format support applies in production).
**Inline OOXML track-changes in the redline export require a `.docx` original** — for any
other format the export still succeeds, but the negotiation trail is rendered as an
appendix rather than as inline `w:ins`/`w:del` marks on the original prose (see
`export/track_changes.py`; covered by `tests/test_export_trail.py`).

Domain: this build is deliberately domain-agnostic (any contract/agreement-shaped
document); the demo uses a synthetic Master Services Agreement between two fictional
companies, Acme Corp and Globex Ltd. A second run with different documents just means
uploading a different `.docx`/`.md`/`.txt`/`.html` file to `/redline` or `POST /deals` —
nothing in the negotiation logic is specific to the demo contract's clauses.

## What we cut, and why

- **No idempotency key on `propose`.** Submitting the same instruction twice starts two
  SuperDocs jobs and bills two operations. Every *decision* path is idempotent — a
  proposal already resolved is refused, and redrawing a card can never invent a vote —
  but the operation that actually costs money is not. The honest fix is a
  caller-supplied idempotency key hashed over `(deal_id, document_id, instruction)`,
  with a short dedupe window; it was cut for time, not because it is hard. Flagged
  because "idempotency wherever an operation costs money" is a standard this build is
  measured against and does not fully meet.
- **The Slack upload path reads the whole file into memory.** `POST /deals/upload` on the
  REST surface streams in chunks with an explicit size cap, but the Slack `file_shared`
  handler downloads the document whole before uploading it. Fine for contracts, which are
  small; not what you would want for genuinely large files, and named here rather than
  implied by the presence of the streaming path next to it.
- **No stage-by-stage cost/latency reporting.** This build's assigned card didn't ask
  for it, and SuperDocs already meters usage via its own operations budget
  (`usage.monthly_used` / `monthly_remaining` on every job). Adding a second cost ledger
  on top would have been scope creep against the S3 card; noted here as an honest cut,
  not an oversight.
- **No `insert_after_chunk_id` positioning in the redline export.** `ProposalRow` doesn't
  persist SuperDocs' chunk-anchor id, so `create` operations in the local track-changes
  export are appended at the end of the document rather than inserted exactly where
  SuperDocs placed them. The clean export (`export_clean`, straight from SuperDocs) is
  always positionally exact; only the *locally rebuilt* redline export has this
  limitation, and it's covered by an honest "Unmatched Changes" section rather than a
  silent wrong-location guess.
- **No revision-round UI beyond what SuperDocs itself drives.** When `dual_consent`
  triggers SuperDocs' automatic revision round (every change in a batch rejected, with
  feedback), we re-post the new proposal cards SuperDocs drafts; we don't build a second,
  separate "counter-proposal" negotiation UI on top of that.
- **The REST server posts to an in-memory messenger, not real Slack.** `main.py` is the
  machine-drivable surface; it does not require a live Slack connection to run or to be
  tested. A real deployment runs `redline.slack.run_slack` as a separate process against
  the same `DATABASE_PATH` and the same SuperDocs session per deal, so both surfaces stay
  consistent — but the REST server, by itself, never posts into real Slack. This is a
  deliberate assumption, not a bug: the REST/MCP surface's job is to be drivable by a
  machine with no human in Slack at all.
- **Search is lexical (substring), not semantic.** It matches case-insensitive substrings
  across document text, proposals, and the audit trail. It will not find "indemnity" when
  you search "who pays if we get sued". SuperDocs exposes a `cross_session_search` flag on
  chat that our client passes through, and Postgres + pgvector is the natural upgrade if
  semantic recall is needed — but a lexical index is honest about what it does, needs no
  embedding budget, and is fully testable offline. Documented as a limitation rather than
  dressed up as semantic search.
- **Search reads original uploaded bytes, not the current version.** Document hits come
  from the file as uploaded; if a clause was later edited, the *proposal* records show the
  change but the document snippet shows the original text. Proposal and audit hits close
  most of that gap, and every hit is labelled by kind so the reader can tell which is
  which.
- **`SIDE_OVERRIDE_USERS` is a testing affordance.** In production the workspace a person
  belongs to (`team_id`) decides their side. The override exists so both roles can be
  exercised from a single Slack workspace during development; it is validated (an unknown
  side is rejected loudly) and covered by `tests/test_identity.py`.

## Assumptions

Logged as the brief asks, rather than waiting for clarification:

- **"Each side approves its own positions"** is read as `dual_consent` by default (both
  sides must approve before a change commits), with `proposer_only` available as the more
  literal reading. Configurable per deal.
- **A second file shared into the channel attaches to the open deal** as a supporting
  document rather than starting a new deal or replacing the contract. Replacing the
  authoritative contract mid-negotiation would silently invalidate every recorded
  decision, so it is not something a drag-and-drop should be able to do by accident.
- **An untargeted `propose` always edits the contract**, never the most recently uploaded
  file, even though SuperDocs' own focus would follow the newest upload. This is enforced
  by `open_mode=background` plus explicit document resolution, and tested.
- **Errors from Slack interactions reply ephemerally to the actor**, never into the shared
  channel — broadcasting one side's operational errors to the counterparty leaks how that
  side is driving the negotiation.
- **Deal identity is the SuperDocs session id.** One deal = one session = one
  authoritative document plus its supporting files.

## Testing

```bash
uv run pytest          # 104 tests
uv run ruff check src tests --fix
```

All tests run offline against `FakeSuperDocs` and `InMemoryMessenger` — no network, no
API key, no real Slack. Coverage by requirement:

| Requirement | Test |
| --- | --- |
| Boundary never leaks internal notes | `tests/test_boundary.py` |
| Documents can't give the system orders | `tests/test_boundary.py::test_document_content_never_treated_as_a_command` |
| Approval policy matrix (`dual_consent` / `proposer_only`) | `tests/test_approval.py` |
| Both sides see one identical, monotonic version | `tests/test_versioning.py` |
| Kill mid-run, resume, exactly-once completion | `tests/test_kill_resume.py` |
| Track-changes export, authors, rejected appendix, unmatched | `tests/test_export_trail.py` |
| Append-only, attributable audit trail | `tests/test_history_audit.py` |
| Full negotiation drivable end-to-end via REST, multipart upload | `tests/test_rest_surface.py` |
| Multi-document deals, targeting, contract stays untouched | `tests/test_multidocument.py` |
| Search respects the internal/external boundary both ways | `tests/test_search.py` |
| Slow jobs report progress; a failed ping never breaks a job | `tests/test_progress.py` |
| Side identity, overrides, and forged cross-side decisions | `tests/test_identity.py` |
| Real HTTP transport: auth, payload shapes, error mapping | `tests/test_live_transport.py` |
| SuperDocs client / fake behavior (from the prior phase) | `tests/test_superdocs_client.py` |
| Deal lifecycle: second document joins, close, promote the authoritative contract | `tests/test_deal_lifecycle.py` |
| Two real workspaces: per-side tokens, per-workspace file ingest | `tests/test_two_workspace.py` |
| Decision outcomes reach both sides; a failed notification never undoes a decision | `tests/test_notifications.py` |
| Block Kit buttons match their listeners; a wrong-side click warns without destroying the card | `tests/test_bolt_wiring.py` |
| Readable deal names, countable version numbers, older databases migrate | `tests/test_display.py` |

`tests/test_live_transport.py` is worth calling out: `FakeSuperDocs` replaces the
transport entirely, so it can never catch a bug in how we actually speak HTTP. That file
drives the real `HTTPTransport` against a mock server to check bearer auth, request
shapes, and error mapping — still with no key and no network.
